# A secure, anonymous and confidential channel of communication between a young person and a trusted counselor

2ndFriend can act as an umbrella and single access point for a variety of help and support organisations. Organisations can choose to become part of the network, which means they have access to requests coming in from various entry points the platform provides. They can also choose to use the 2ndFriend platform with their own branding, which allows them to define their own access points (e.g. via their own website). Even a combination is possible, where the organisation offers their own branded access point in addition to being part of the 2ndFriend network accessible through the central entry points.

The service is multi-channel starting from a grass roots level in order to allow the organisations to compound their reach and impact while enabling young people to connect with the best possible individuals for their circumstance.
