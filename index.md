### Welcome to SecondFriend

*SecondFriend* is a platform that provides a secure, anonymous, confidential communication channel between a young person and a trusted counselor from relevant organisation, via the click of a button. The roots of this project idea were originally conceived at [Hack4Kids](http://2012.euhackathon.eu/) in Brussels in June 2012, and have as since been identified as highly relevant to children, young migrants and other help seekers and capable of filling a gap in services currently available.

*SecondFriend* can act as an umbrella and single access point for a variety of help and support organisations. Organisations can choose to become part of the network, which means they have access to requests coming in from various entry points the platform provides. They can also choose to use the *SecondFriend* platform with their own branding, which allows them to define their own access points e.g. via their own website. Even a combination is possible, where the organisation offers their own branded access point in addition to being part of the *SecondFriend* network accessible through the central entry points.

The service is multi-channel starting from a grass roots level in order to allow the organisations to compound their reach and impact while enabling young people to connect with the best possible individuals for their circumstance. Our product has several entry points (with prototypes of 1. and 2. already in existence):

1. a browser plugin (currently Google Chrome, will be ported to Firefox)
2. a mobile-friendly website/webapp (native Android / iOS apps are planned)
3. an SMS gateway that guarantees anonymity
